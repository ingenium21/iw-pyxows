# iw-pyxows
 this is the beginning of my testing the pyxows library 

## purpose 
Writing this code to amplify our monitoring of our telehealth devices.  We would like to log calls and send them to a log analysis tool.  

## running
1. create a `.env` file (use env.example as a template)
2. run either `simpleExample.py` to get a simple example or run `callSubscription.py` and place a call to your medview.  

## Outstanding things I need to get done
* send these to my log analysis tool
* scale this out to multiple devices
* containerize all of this in k8s
